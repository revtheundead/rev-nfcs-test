# NFCS Test WinForm App
This is a Windows Form Application which automates the Need For Closure Test found [here](https://www.kruglanskiarie.com/need-for-closure).

## Dependencies
You will need to reference Microsoft Office Excel assembly in order to run this. 

## Why C++/CLI?
Because I felt like I should learn it.

## Running the app
There is an executable file (```NFCSTestV2.exe```) located in ```/Debug```. Running the executable should start up the forms.

## Modifying
You may want to use Visual Studio Community as any other IDE seems to get errors.
